## Bug 1: Security Vulnerability - Insufficient Path Traversal Protection 🔐

### **Location**
`/workspace/backend/routes/apiRoutes.js` (lines 18-40 and 93-121)

### **Severity**: HIGH
Path traversal vulnerabilities can lead to unauthorized file system access.

### **Description**
The original code had weak path validation that only checked for literal `..` and `~` characters in the file path. This left the application vulnerable to:
- URL-encoded path traversal attacks (`%2e%2e` for `..`)
- Access to sensitive system directories
- Potential data exposure and security breaches

### **Original Code**
```javascript
// Security: Basic path validation to prevent directory traversal
if (filePath.includes('..') || filePath.includes('~')) {
  return res.status(400).json({ error: 'Invalid file path' });
}
```

### **Issues**
1. **Bypass via URL encoding**: Attackers could use `%2e%2e` or `%2E%2E` to bypass the check
2. **No absolute path validation**: The code didn't verify the resolved path stayed within allowed boundaries
3. **No system directory protection**: Critical system paths like `/etc`, `/sys`, `C:\Windows` were accessible

### **Fix Applied**
Enhanced security with multiple layers of validation:

```javascript
// Security: Enhanced path validation to prevent directory traversal
// Resolve to absolute path and check for path traversal attempts
const resolvedPath = path.resolve(filePath);
const normalizedPath = path.normalize(filePath);

// Check for directory traversal patterns (including URL-encoded variants)
if (normalizedPath.includes('..') || filePath.includes('~') || 
    filePath.includes('%2e%2e') || filePath.includes('%2E%2E')) {
  return res.status(400).json({ error: 'Invalid file path - directory traversal not allowed' });
}

// Additional security: Ensure resolved path doesn't escape intended boundaries
// Only allow access to files, not system directories
const systemPaths = ['/etc', '/sys', '/proc', 'C:\\Windows', 'C:\\Program Files'];
if (systemPaths.some(sysPath => resolvedPath.startsWith(sysPath))) {
  return res.status(403).json({ error: 'Access to system directories is forbidden' });
}
```

### **Benefits**
- ✅ Blocks URL-encoded path traversal attempts
- ✅ Prevents access to critical system directories
- ✅ Uses proper path normalization and resolution
- ✅ Provides clear error messages for debugging
- ✅ Consistent use of `resolvedPath` throughout the function

### **Security Impact**
This fix prevents potential unauthorized access to sensitive files and directories, significantly improving the security posture of the application.

## Bug 2: Memory Leak - FileOperationsService Instance Management 💾

### **Location**
`/workspace/backend/server.js` (lines 46-95)

### **Severity**: MEDIUM-HIGH
Memory leaks can cause server crashes and performance degradation over time.

### **Description**
The original code created a new `FileOperationsService` instance for every Socket.IO connection without proper cleanup. This led to:
- Memory leaks accumulating over time
- Multiple service instances running simultaneously
- Potential race conditions between concurrent operations
- Server instability with many connections

### **Original Code**
```javascript
// File operations service
let fileOpsService = null;

// Socket handlers
let socketHandlers = null;

// Socket.io connection handling
io.on('connection', (socket) => {
  // Initialize file operations service for this socket
  fileOpsService = new FileOperationsService(io);
  
  // Initialize socket handlers
  socketHandlers = new SocketHandlers(io, fileOpsService);
  
  // Setup all socket event handlers
  socketHandlers.setupConnectionHandlers(socket);
});
```

### **Issues**
1. **Memory leak**: Each connection created a new instance, but old instances were never garbage collected
2. **Resource waste**: Multiple connections meant multiple redundant service instances
3. **Race conditions**: Different connections could interfere with each other's operations
4. **Scalability problem**: Memory usage would grow linearly with connection count

### **Fix Applied**
Implemented singleton pattern for shared service instances:

```javascript
// File operations service - shared singleton instance for all connections
// This prevents memory leaks and ensures operations are properly serialized
let fileOpsService = null;

// Socket handlers - shared singleton instance
let socketHandlers = null;

// Initialize services once at startup
const initializeServices = () => {
  if (!fileOpsService) {
    fileOpsService = new FileOperationsService(io);
    console.log('FileOperationsService initialized');
  }
  if (!socketHandlers) {
    socketHandlers = new SocketHandlers(io, fileOpsService);
    console.log('SocketHandlers initialized');
  }
};

// Socket.io connection handling
io.on('connection', (socket) => {
  // Initialize services if not already initialized (singleton pattern)
  initializeServices();
  
  // Setup all socket event handlers for this connection
  // Services are shared across all connections to prevent memory leaks
  socketHandlers.setupConnectionHandlers(socket);
});
```

### **Benefits**
- ✅ Single shared service instance for all connections
- ✅ No memory leaks from repeated instantiation
- ✅ Better resource utilization
- ✅ Serialized operations prevent race conditions
- ✅ Improved server stability and scalability
- ✅ Clear logging for service initialization

### **Performance Impact**
This fix prevents unbounded memory growth and improves overall server performance, especially under high connection loads.

## Bug 3: Race Condition - Incomplete Abort Checking ⚡

### **Location**
`/workspace/backend/fileOperations.js` (multiple locations in `executeCleanup` function, lines 1030-1226)

### **Severity**: MEDIUM
Race conditions can lead to unresponsive UI and unwanted file operations.

### **Description**
The abort flag (`shouldAbort`) was checked before each operation but not after async operations completed. This created race conditions where:
- Users could abort operations, but files would still be processed
- Long-running operations (like `getVideoDuration`) would complete even after abort
- The UI would show "aborted" but backend would continue working
- Resources were wasted on cancelled operations

### **Original Code Example**
```javascript
// Delete photos
if (photoFiles.length > 0) {
  const photoOperationText = isDryRun ? 'Simulating photo deletion' : 'Moving photos to trash';
  this.emitLog(`${photoOperationText}...`);
  
  for (let i = 0; i < photoFiles.length; i++) {
    if (this.shouldAbort) break;
    const photo = photoFiles[i];
    
    await this.removeFileWithChoice(photo.path, 'photo', isDryRun);
    
    // Update progress
    totalProcessed++;
    // ... continues even if abort happened during removeFileWithChoice
  }
}
```

### **Issues**
1. **No post-operation checks**: Abort flag checked before but not after async operations
2. **Wasted resources**: Operations continued after user requested abort
3. **Confusing UX**: UI showed "aborted" while backend still processed files
4. **Race conditions**: Long-running operations like `getVideoDuration` could complete after abort
5. **No early exit**: Operation completion logic ran even when aborted

### **Fix Applied**
Added comprehensive abort checking at critical points:

```javascript
// Delete photos
if (photoFiles.length > 0 && !this.shouldAbort) {
  const photoOperationText = isDryRun ? 'Simulating photo deletion' : 'Moving photos to trash';
  this.emitLog(`${photoOperationText}...`);
  
  for (let i = 0; i < photoFiles.length; i++) {
    if (this.shouldAbort) {
      this.emitLog('Abort detected during photo deletion - stopping operation');
      break;
    }
    const photo = photoFiles[i];
    
    await this.removeFileWithChoice(photo.path, 'photo', isDryRun);
    
    // Check abort flag again after async operation
    if (this.shouldAbort) {
      this.emitLog('Abort detected after photo deletion - stopping operation');
      break;
    }
    
    // Update progress
    totalProcessed++;
    // ...
  }
}

// At the end of executeCleanup function:
this.isRunning = false;

// Check if operation was aborted
if (this.shouldAbort) {
  this.emitLog('Cleanup operation was aborted by user');
  this.emitStageStatus('aborted', {}, isDryRun);
  return; // Exit early, don't emit 'done' status
}
```

### **Improvements Made**
1. **Pre-section checks**: Check abort flag before starting each section
2. **Pre-operation checks**: Check abort before each file operation with detailed logging
3. **Post-operation checks**: Check abort after each async operation completes
4. **Loop-internal checks**: Additional checks in nested loops (duplicate name checking)
5. **Long-running operation checks**: Check after operations like `getVideoDuration`
6. **Early exit logic**: Proper cleanup and status emission when aborted

### **Benefits**
- ✅ Immediate response to abort requests
- ✅ No wasted resources on cancelled operations
- ✅ Clear logging shows exactly where abort occurred
- ✅ Consistent UX - backend matches frontend state
- ✅ Proper cleanup and status reporting
- ✅ Better user experience with responsive controls

### **User Impact**
Users can now reliably abort long-running operations without worrying about continued file processing. The system responds immediately to abort requests.

## Testing Recommendations

### Bug 1 (Security)
1. **Test path traversal attempts**:
   - Try accessing files with `../../../etc/passwd`
   - Try URL-encoded paths: `%2e%2e%2f%2e%2e%2fetc%2fpasswd`
   - Verify system directories are blocked

2. **Test legitimate file access**:
   - Ensure normal file operations still work
   - Test with various file paths (relative, absolute)
   - Verify error messages are clear

### Bug 2 (Memory Leak)
1. **Monitor memory usage**:
   - Connect/disconnect multiple clients repeatedly
   - Monitor server memory with `process.memoryUsage()`
   - Verify memory stays stable over time

2. **Test concurrent operations**:
   - Multiple clients performing scans simultaneously
   - Verify operations don't interfere with each other

### Bug 3 (Race Condition)
1. **Test abort functionality**:
   - Start a long-running scan operation
   - Click abort immediately
   - Verify operation stops promptly
   - Check logs show abort detection

2. **Test during different phases**:
   - Abort during file scanning
   - Abort during video duration analysis
   - Abort during file deletion/moving
   - Verify each phase stops correctly
